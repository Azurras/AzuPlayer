# AzuPlayer

## Intro

This is a neat little media player I started writing back in 2012. Back then
I got as far getting it to play some WAV files. I started making changes to it again
in 2021. Right now, the structure of the code is a bit better, but it doesn't play
the music anymore. There seems to be a lack of support for the library I originally used
to play those WAV files, so I'll need to find a new one.


## Getting Started

### Building
``mvn clean package``

### Confessions

I've only ever run this thing in the debugger, so it doesn't build any jar files to run.
If you want to run it, then I recommend doing it in the debugger for now.
